--6. Via the video, you might be interested in how to calculate the MEDIAN. Though this is more advanced than what we have covered so far try finding - what is the MEDIAN total_usd spent on all orders? Note, this is more advanced than the topics we have covered thus far to build a general solution, but we can hard code a solution in the following way.

SELECT *
FROM (SELECT total_amt_usd
      FROM orders
      ORDER BY total_amt_usd
      LIMIT 3457) AS Table1
ORDER BY total_amt_usd DESC
LIMIT 2;
