# Write a procedure, speed_fraction, which takes as its inputs the result of
# a traceroute (in ms) and distance (in km) between two points. It should 
# return the speed the data travels as a decimal fraction of the speed of
# light.

speed_of_light = 300000. # km per second

def speed_fraction(traceroute, distance):
    speed_of_light_ms = 300000. / 1000
    return (distance/ (traceroute+0.0)) * 2 / speed_of_light_ms



print speed_fraction(50,5000)
#>>> 0.666666666667

print speed_fraction(50,10000)
#>>> 1.33333333333  # Any thoughts about this answer, or these inputs?
