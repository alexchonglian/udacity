# 6. In video 28. Update, it was suggested that some of the duplicate code in
# lookup and update could be avoided by a better design.  We can do this by
# defining a procedure that finds the entry corresponding to a given key, and
# using that in both lookup and update.

# Here are the original procedures:

def hashtable_update(htable, key, value):
    htable[key] = value

def hashtable_lookup(htable, key):
    if key in htable:
        return htable[key]
    return None

def make_hashtable(size):
    table = {}
    return table

# Whenever we have duplicate code like the loop that finds the entry in
# hashtable_update and hashtable_lookup, we should think if there is a better way
# to write this that would avoid the duplication. We should be able to rewrite
# these procedures to be shorter by defining a new procedure and rewriting both
# hashtable_update and hashtable_lookup to use that procedure.

# Modify the code for both hashtable_update and hashtable_lookup to have the same
# behavior they have now, but using fewer lines of code in each procedure.  You
# should define a new procedure to help with this. Your new version should have
# approximately the same running time as the original version, but neither
# hashtable_update or hashtable_lookup should include any for or while loop, and
# the block of each procedure should be no more than 6 lines long.

# Your procedures should have the same behavior as the originals.  For example,

table = make_hashtable(10)
hashtable_update(table, 'Python', 'Monty')
hashtable_update(table, 'CLU', 'Barbara Liskov')
hashtable_update(table, 'JavaScript', 'Brendan Eich')
hashtable_update(table, 'Python', 'Guido van Rossum')
print hashtable_lookup(table, 'Python')
#>>> Guido van Rossum
